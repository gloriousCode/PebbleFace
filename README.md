# PebbleFace
First time making a watchface for Pebble Time

Concept
The idea of this watchface is to deliver information that I find useful, when it is useful to me.
Eg at 15:30 show me upcoming bus times
16:10 Show me upcoming train times


Timeline intergration
This watchface will also pin upcoming events to my timeline so that I know what I need to do
Eg Pin task telling me to go to the gym today


Finally, I'm making this watchface open source so that others find it easy to develop for Pebble. It will be split up into small tasks as much as possible, so people can use only what's relevant to them
